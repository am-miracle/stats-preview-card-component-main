## My process

I started with building the mobile layout first  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt how to make use of flex box,overlay
I also learnt how to use  @media Query to View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .container .picture .overlay{
    background-color: hsla(277, 64%, 61%,0.6);
    height: 250px;
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
}
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on making responsive website and make it making it accessible to work with
